# Work Time

## Introduction

Currently, I use two iPhone apps ([HoursTracker](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hourstracker-hours-pay/id336456412) and [Time Off](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/time-off/id414400455)) to do what I consider to be task - manage my work time!  This is anoying.  What's more, data is not combined meaning I have to send data from these apps seperately to my line manager.

I'm a programmer - so I'm going to `scratch my own itch`.


## Expectations 

The app should:

- allow me to manage all of the tasks I need to do (clock in, clock out, take leave etc) in one simple and easy to use app 
- work and behave the same across all my devices (browser, iPad and iPhone)
- allow me to send combined day-by-day data (via email) to my line manager as-and-when required - ideally scheduled
